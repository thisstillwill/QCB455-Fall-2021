## Final Project

The final project constituted a substantial (45% of the final grade) effort that reproduced part of an existing paper ([Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the United
States suggests presence of four substrains
and novel variants](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01754-6))[^1]. The complete writeup and source files can found on arXiv (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07770>) or in the `final_project` directory.
